## Business background

-   The business context around the project
-   Usages of the project target
    -   The scope of the project such as only applicable to selected lines of business or product groups
-   Existing process
    -   Problems/concerns with the current process
    -   Performance of the current process
-   Expectations of the project deliveries
-   Evaluation metrics of the project outcomes
-   Upstream/Downstream tools and models

## Modeling

### Conceptual model or guidances from subject-matter experts (SMEs)

-   Ideas and business process theory recommended by SMEs
    -   Define of the model target/outcome
    -   Define of the observational unit
    -   Guide the process of looking for useful data sources
    -   Provide some guidance about sensible or expected relationships among features or with the target
-   The context or subject journey that can affect the target of interest

### Data

-   List and short descriptions of all data sources used.
-   Data processing notes
    -   Define the model target/outcome in clear technical definition (if needed to be created)
    -   Describe the data processing pipeline
-   Train and test set splitting process

### Data insights

-   Description of the training data period/sample
    -   Counts
    -   Time period if there is a time dimension
-   Summary and highlights about the target
    -   Distribution
    -   Missingness
-   Summary and highlights about the independent variables
    -   Distribution
    -   Missingness
-   Any features generated and why
-   Any key potential (predictive) relationships among features and with the target

### Model methodology

-   A summary of the model ethology
-   Citations to the theoretical models
-   Models tested
-   Model selection
-   Variable selection
-   Hyper-parameter tuning

### Model diagnostics

-   Feature importance
-   Training errors
    -   Error distribution
        -   QQ-plot
    -   Evaluation metrics
    -   Error versus predicted
    -   Error versus actual
    -   Error versus key features
    -   Errors versus time/index (if autocorrelation is a suspected)

### Model interpretability

-   Model predictions for selected profiles

## Model implementation

### Data input

-   List all the data sources needed to provide data inputs for model run
-   Summary of any concerns about data gaps between training and production environment \### Production environment
-   Diagram or description of the production pipeline
-   Back-up plan for model failures

### Model production

-   A summary of the model production process and all inputs needed.
-   The documentation should be sufficient for an independent ML Ops team to be able to put the model into production with minimal in-person guidance.

## Model monitoring and maintenance

### Model monitoring

-   Monitoring metrics
-   Thresholds and actions recommended, for example
    -   If RMSE is below the lowest threshold, no action needed
    -   If RMSE is above the lowest threshold, investigate the cause
    -   If RMSE goes over certain levels, immediately stop the model in production and move to back-up plan

### Model automatic update/retraining schedule

-   Production setup to support automatic training
    -   Test set evaluation
    -   Compare current versus new model
-   Analysis results supported this automatic updating schedule
